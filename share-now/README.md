## Prerequisite
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), fully tested on NodeJS 14, 16
- A Microsoft 365 account. If you do not have Microsoft 365 account, apply one from [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- Latest [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

## What you will learn in this sample
- How to build frontend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to build backend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to build message extension bot on Azure for your app.
- How to connect to Azure SQL DB and how to do CRUD operations in DB.

## Try the Sample
>Here are the instructions to run the sample in **Visual Studio Code**. You can also try to run the app using TeamsFx CLI tool, refer to [Try the Sample with TeamsFx CLI](cli.md)
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install 'Teams Toolkit' extension.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Open **env/.env.dev** file, set value for `SQL_USER_NAME` and `SQL_PASSWORD`
1. Open the command palette and select: `Teams: Provision in the cloud`. You will be asked to input admin name and password of SQL. The toolkit will help you to provision Azure SQL.
1. Once provision is completed, open the command palette and select: `Teams: Deploy to the cloud`.
1. Open **env/.env.dev** file, you could get the database name in `PROVISIONOUTPUT__AZURESQLOUTPUT__DATABASENAME` output. [Set IP address of your computer into server-level IP firewall rule from the database overview page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure#from-the-database-overview-page).
1. In Azure portal, find the database by `databaseName` and use [query editor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-portal) with below query to create a table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [TeamPostEntity](
	    [PostID] [int] PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
	    [ContentUrl] [nvarchar](400) NOT NULL,
	    [CreatedByName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	    [CreatedDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,
	    [Description] [nvarchar](500) NOT NULL,
	    [IsRemoved] [bit] NOT NULL,
	    [Tags] [nvarchar](100) NULL,
	    [Title] [nvarchar](100) NOT NULL,
	    [TotalVotes] [int] NOT NULL,
	    [Type] [int] NOT NULL,
	    [UpdatedDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,
	    [UserID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    )
    GO
    CREATE TABLE [UserVoteEntity](
	    [VoteID] [int] PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
	    [PostID] [int] NOT NULL,
	    [UserID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    )
    GO
    ```
1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the app running in Azure. In Visual Studio Code, open `Run and Debug` and select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` in the dropdown list and Press `F5` or green arrow button to open a browser.

## (Optional) Debug
To debug the project, you will need to configure an Azure SQL Database to be used locally:
1. [Create an Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?tabs=azure-portal)
1. [Add IP address of your computer into allowlist of firewall of Azure SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure#from-the-database-overview-page)
1. Use [query editor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-portal) with below query to create tables:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [TeamPostEntity](
	    [PostID] [int] PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
	    [ContentUrl] [nvarchar](400) NOT NULL,
	    [CreatedByName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	    [CreatedDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,
	    [Description] [nvarchar](500) NOT NULL,
	    [IsRemoved] [bit] NOT NULL,
	    [Tags] [nvarchar](100) NULL,
	    [Title] [nvarchar](100) NOT NULL,
	    [TotalVotes] [int] NOT NULL,
	    [Type] [int] NOT NULL,
	    [UpdatedDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,
	    [UserID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    )
    GO
    CREATE TABLE [UserVoteEntity](
	    [VoteID] [int] PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
	    [PostID] [int] NOT NULL,
	    [UserID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    )
    GO
    ```
1. Open **env/.env.local** file, and set the values of below config with the Azure SQL Database you just created:
    ```
    SQL_ENDPOINT=
    SQL_DATABASE_NAME=
    SQL_USER_NAME=
    SQL_PASSWORD=
    ```
1. Open Debug View (`Ctrl+Shift+D`) and select "Debug (Edge)" or "Debug (Chrome)" in dropdown list.
1. Press "F5" to open a browser window and then select your package to view share now sample app. 

## Use the App in Teams

1. The app will look like this when it runs for the first time:

	![Share Now](images/StartPage.png)

## Architecture

![Tab App Flow](images/app.png)

This sample app consists of a personal tab and a message extension used to manage, search and share posts.
- The frontend is a react tab app hosted on [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).
- The Backend server is hosted on [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) for managing posts in the tab app.
- The message extension is hosted on [Azure Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview) for searching and sharing posts.
- The [Azure SQL DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/) used to persist data.

### Code structure

- You can check app configuration in `teamsapp.*.yml` files
- You can check app environment information in: [env](env)
- You will find frontend code in: [tabs/src/components](tabs/src/components)
- You will find backend code in: [api/posts](api/posts), [api/vote](api/vote)
- You will find bot code in: [bot](bot)
- You will find DB Connection code in: [api/utils/common.ts](api/utils/common.ts)

# Getting Started with Graph Connector Bot Sample

This sample app showcases how to build a Teams command bot that queries custom data ingested into Microsoft Graph using Graph connector.

![Graph Connector Overview](images/graph-connector-bot-demo.gif)

## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), fully tested on NodeJS 14, 16
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- An Microsoft 365 account with admin permission. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)

## What you will learn in this sample:
- How to handle webhook notification when Graph connector is turned on or off in Teams Admin Center.
- How to use Microsoft Graph API to integrate with Microsoft Graph connector.
- How to use TeamsFx SDK to build bot to query data from Microsoft Graph connector.

## Try the Sample with Visual Studio Code Extension:

### Local Debug the Sample
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit).
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Open Debug View (`Ctrl+Shift+D`) and select "Debug (Edge)" or "Debug (Chrome)" in dropdown list.
1. Press "F5" to open a browser window and then select your package to view sample app. 
1. Find the Teams package in `build\appPackage\appPackage.local.zip`.
1. Navigate to [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps), and upload the Teams package.
    > **Note**: If you are testing in a new debug session again, you need to delete the existing Teams app in Teams Admin Center and upload a new one, since the ngrok endpoint will change when you start a new debug session.

### (Optional) Provision and Deploy the Sample to Azure
> If you don't have an Azure subscription, create [a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) before you begin
1. Open the command palette and select `Teams: Provision in the cloud`. You will be asked to select Azure resource group to provision the sample.
1. Once provision is completed, open the command palette and select `Teams: Deploy to the cloud`.
1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the APP running in Azure. In Visual Studio Code, open `Run and Debug` and select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` in the dropdown list and Press `F5` or green arrow button to open a browser.
1. Use Teams Toolkit to [submit the Teams app to the Teams Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/publish#publish-to-your-organization).
1. [Approve the Teams app for publishing to your organization's app store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/publish#admin-approval-for-teams-apps).

## Use the app in Teams
1. Navigate to 'Graph Connector' section of the Teams app in [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps), and click 'Grant permissions'.

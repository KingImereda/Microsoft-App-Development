## Prerequisites
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) (Recommend LTS 14.x)
    >  The SharePoint Framework v1.12.1 is supported on the following Node.js versions:
    >- Node.js v10.13.0+ (Dubnium)
    >- Node.js v12.13.0+ (Erbium)
    >- Node.js v14.15.0+ (Fermium) 
* Setup SharePoint Environment by following the [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant).
* Use the communication root site in SharePoint to create a List.
    - Navigate to the SharePoint root site, in `Home` tab, click `New` and select `List`. 
    > *Note: You must nagivate to root site instead of any other subsite. Root site URL ends with xx.sharepoint.com.* eg. `https://{your-tenant-name}.sharepoint.com/`. 
    > *This is because Teams App automatically detect SharePoint root site only. If you want to create a List in other subsite, manual steps to change the site url in* *[./SPFx/src/webparts/TodoList/components/SharePointListManager.ts](./SPFx/src/webparts/TodoList/components/SharePointListManager.ts) are required.*
    - Name the List 'To Do List'
    - Click `Add Column`, select `Single line of text`, name the column 'description'
    - Click `Add Column`, select `Yes/No`, name the column 'isCompleted'
* [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit)
* [Optional] If you want your users see only the items created by themselves, add access control to your List.
    - In List Page, click `setting` button and then choose `list setting`.

## Try the Sample
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code. 
1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit).
1. Open [./SPFx/src/webparts/TodoList/components/SharePointListManager.ts](./SPFx/src/webparts/TodoList/components/SharePointListManager.ts), navigate to line:16, set the `listname` variable to your SharePoint List name.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code, click `Provision in the Cloud` in PROJECT panel of Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension or open the command palette and select `Teams: Provision in the Cloud`. This step will create an app in Teams App Studio.
1. Go back to Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension, click `Deploy to the Cloud` in PROJECT panel or open the command palette and select `Teams: Deploy to the Cloud`. 
    > This step will generate a SharePoint package (*.sppkg) under `sharepoint/solution` folder.
1. Upload or drag-and-drop the *.sppkg file under `sharepoint/solution` folder to the SharePoint App Catalog site, follow the instruction [Deploy the HelloWorld package to App Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/serve-your-web-part-in-a-sharepoint-page#deploy-the-helloworld-package-to-app-catalog)
    > Note: Tick the "Make this solution available to all sites in the organization" option to make the solution available in Teams.
3. Go back to Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension, in in PROJECT panel, click `Publish to Teams` or open the command palette and select `Teams: Publish to Teams`.
4. Check the published app in [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) by searching "todoList" in the search box.

NPM Search Connector is a Messaging Extension that allows you to perform a quick search to NPM Registry for a package and insert package details into conversations for sharing with your co-workers. The front end is built with Adaptive Cards to render NPM package details and the backend is an Azure Bot Service handling search queries and communication between the server workload and the clients, including Teams and Outlook (Web Client).

## Prerequisite
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- [Set up your dev environment for extending Teams apps across Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-m365-apps-prerequisites)

## What you will learn in this sample:
- How to build message extension bot on Azure for your app.
- How to use Teams Toolkit to build a message extension app that runs across M365 including Teams and Outlook (Web)

## Try the Sample with Visual Studio Code Extension:
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
2. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit).
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
4. Open the command palette and select `Teams: Provision in the cloud`.
5. Once provision is completed, open the command palette and select `Teams: Deploy to the cloud`.
6. Once deployment is completed, from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your bot resource. From *Settings*, select **Channels**. Click on **Outlook**, select the **Message Extensions** tab and then click **Save**.

## Use the app in Teams
In a conversation, open the **Messaging extensions** flyout menu on the bottom of the composition window. Your message extension will be listed and you can invoke it from there. Type a NPM package that you want to search and select one from the search results.

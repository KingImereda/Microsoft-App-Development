Bots can be used to automate repetitive workflows through a conversational interface which can be used in different Microsoft Teams contexts, such as a personal bot chat, one to one or group chat, a channel conversation and within meetings.

The Place Your Order workflow bot shows you how to implement a simple workflow that uses a command to start an order process which returns an Adaptive Card containing a form in the response to the command. The bot captures the submission of the Adaptive Card confirming the submitted data in an Adaptive Card which replaces the initial form card.

Chatbots on Microsoft Teams are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with users in a meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails to answer a question well.

FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. A user can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot offers the user an option to "Ask an expert", which posts the question to a pre-configured team of experts to provide support. An expert can assign the question to themself, chat with the user to gain more context.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit)
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

### What you will learn in this sample:

- How to use TeamsFx to build a bot app.
- How to connect a Teams bot to an external system.
- How to use the Teams Toolkit to provision and deploy your app to Azure.

### Try the Sample

1. FAQ Plus Bot relies on the 'QnA Maker' Azure services. Before you start, follow the [instructions](docs/deploy-qna-maker-services.md) to deploy QnA Maker to Azure. You will get configurations of QnA Maker service on completion. Make sure to record them down and you will need this later. 
2. Open project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), ensure you have installed [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit)
3. Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P / ⌘⇧-P or View -> Command - Palette` and select: `Teams: Provision in the cloud`. If you have not logged in with your Azure Account, you will be asked to login and select a subscription to provision resources for this Bot.
4. Once provision is completed, open `.fx/env.default.json` file. Notice the value of `siteName` in `fx-resource-bot` section, this is the name of Azure Web App service provisioned by Teams Toolkit. You will need this value in step 5.
5. From [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), navigate to resource group named `FaqPlus-rg`. This resource group is created by Teams Toolkit during provision. Find the Azure Web App service named after the value of `siteName` parameter you got from step 4 and open this Azure Web App service.
6. Click `Configuration` in left panel. Add the following application settings with configuration values you got from step 1 and click `Save` button.
    | Application Setting Name | Expected Value | Note |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | SCORETHRESHOLD | 0.5 | The expected value works fine for the sample. You can adjust this threshold per your requirement. |
    | STORAGECONNECTIONSTRING | `StorageConnectionString` got in [deploy-qna-maker-services](docs/deploy-qna-maker-services.md) step | Example: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[AccountName];AccountKey=[Key] |
    | QNAMAKERAPIENDPOINTURL | `QnAMakerApiEndpointUrl` got in [deploy-qna-maker-services](docs/deploy-qna-maker-services.md) step | Example: https://[Location].api.cognitive.microsoft.com |
